        <h1>⚡ Zany Web Wizard Alert! 🌟</h1>
        <p>Hey there! I'm Zany "CodeCruncher" , and I have practically been glued to computers since I was knee-high! 💻 My journey began in 2018, and that ignited a fiery passion for coding that still burns bright today.

            Fast-forward to now, I am fluent in the language of various programming realms and have had the thrill of journeying through roles in both a Recruitment Company and a SaaS Company. 🚀 My coding adventures revolve around crafting cool creations, automating tasks with lines of code, and diving deep into Web & Mobile Development, Open Source projects, and the adrenaline-pumping world of Competitive Programming.
            
            When I am not in the coding dojo, you'll catch me battling it out in epic gaming sessions with my pals, binge-watching the latest Netflix shows, or hitting the courts for some slam-dunk action in basketball! 🏀 Let's keep the coding magic alive and kicking! #CodeCruncher #WebWizard 🌈✨</p>
